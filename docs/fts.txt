  FULL TEXT SEARCHING
  
  FTS allows interfaces (including WEB) to to find records matching set of
  words, found inside multiple fields in a record.
  
  All fields, which should be included in FTS on this table must be marked
  with 'FTS':
  
  
      # table is named PERSONS (persons.def file)
      
      =NAME
          type CHAR   64
          label Personal name
          fts
          
      =ADDR    
          type CHAR   128
          label Personal address
          fts
          
  After marking required fields with 'FTS', supporting tables and the actual
  FTS index must be rebuilt:
  
  cd decor/core/bin
  ./decor-update-fts.pl  app1  persons
  
  This will write required support tables:
  
  decor/apps/app1/tables/__auto__/fts/persons_ftw.def
  decor/apps/app1/tables/__auto__/fts/persons_ftm.def
  
  There are the word index and map index.
  Then decor-update-fts.pl will rebuild database for these two tables and
  start rebuilding FTS index by reading all records' NAME and ADDR fields
  (those marked with FTS).
  
  NOTE: currently all FTS marked fields will be considered FTS grid filters
        and used as such. this will be changed with an option.
