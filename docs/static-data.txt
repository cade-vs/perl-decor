  TABLE STATIC DATA

  Static data is the table data required for intial setup of the application's
  database. Static data is stored and read from files with the name of the table
  and specific data type extension in directory named 'static'.
  For example:
  
  $DECOR_ROOT/app/test_app1/static/cities.csv
  
  Currently only semicolon-delimited CSVs are recognised.
  
  TODO: handle comma-separated CSVs and more formats (XML,JSON,etc.)
  
  Table definition files, table/*.def files, can hold also static data at 
  their end, after line marked with:
  
      __STATIC__
      
  All lines after this line are considered static data until the end of file 
  or until line marked with:
  
      __END__
