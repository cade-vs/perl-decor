  ------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each menu item begins with '=' followed by menu ID. Menu ID will be
  used as a menu item label if 'label' is missing.
  
  'label' gives the 'user friendly' menu item description.
  
  'type' defines the menu item type. The following types are recognized:
  
      "grid" -- takes one argument, table name, displays grid with data
      
      "insert" -- takes one argument, table name, displays insert screen 
      
      "submenu" -- takes one argument, submenu name, forwards to new menu
      
  For 'grant' and 'deny' permissions, please, check the "table-definitions.txt"
  file, section "PERMISSIONS, GRANT/DENY ACCESS".    

  Menus are merged with the core root menus, however thyey are not shown
  unless explicitly requested.
  
  Main menu is named simply 'main' and is the root menu, visible by all users.
  
  Each menu item, including submenu, can have different permissions and 
  access groups.

  Meanwhile, see the demo applications in the "apps" directory:
