  ------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each menu item begins with '=' followed by menu ID. Menu ID will be
  used as a menu item label if 'label' is missing.
  
  'label'   gives the 'user friendly' menu item description.
  
  'type'    defines the menu item type. The following types are recognized:
  
      "grid"    -- takes one argument, table name, displays grid with data
      
      "insert"  -- takes one argument, table name, displays insert screen 
      
      "submenu" -- takes one argument, submenu name, forwards to new menu

      "action"  -- takes one argument, action name, forwards to new action
      
  For 'grant' and 'deny' permissions, please, check the "table-definitions.txt"
  file, section "PERMISSIONS, GRANT/DENY ACCESS".    
  
  'right'   puts menu item on the right side of the main (top) menu, in reverse 
            order.
          
  'confirm' has one optional argument (confirmation text) and will show
            confirmation box (with the given text or 'Are you sure?') before
            activationg menu item (see item "Logout" in core/menu/main.def).        

  Menus are merged with the core root menus, however thyey are not shown
  unless explicitly requested.
  
  Main menu is named simply 'main' and is the top menu, visible by all users
  (including anonimous if ANON access is enabled, see "anon.txt" for details).
  
  Each menu item, including submenu, can have different permissions and 
  access groups.
