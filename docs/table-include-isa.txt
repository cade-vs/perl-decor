  TABLE DESCRIPTION INCLUDE/ISA

  All table descriptions can include parts of another table (or even the
  whole table). All included fields are placed in the original order but
  at the current table position. Include can be used anywhere in the current
  table description or even used alone to get the same table with different
  name. Include syntax is:


      @include <origin_table_name> <argument_list>

      <origin_table_name> is the table name from which fields must be copied.
      <argument_list> is lsit of field names which must be copied.

  There are special cases inside <argument_list>. Any position can be one of:

      *       replaced with a list of all fields from <origin_table_name>
      @       copy table attributes from <origin_table_name>
      **      same as "* @"
      <field_name>    explicit name of the field to be copied
      -<field_name>   remove field from the argument list

      -<field_name> is useful to remove fields after '*' or '**'.

  Adding and removing fields can have wildcard '*' in names:
  
  # add all fields with names starting with DIM, remove DIM_TIME
  # and finally remove all fields ending with _STAMP

  @include   SRC_TABLE   DIM*   -DIM_TIME   -*_STAMP

  After cascading @isa/@include requests, current table may end with unwanted
  fields. To remove them there is a @remove:
  
      @remove  <field> <field> <field>...
      
  It removes all specified fields (allowing wildcards as well). For example:
  
      @remove   CNT    OWNER*    *_STAMP
