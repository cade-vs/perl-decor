#  INTRODUCTION

DECOR is Perl infrastructure for building general purpose information
systems/applications.

DECOR includes set of libraries and database tools, client-server host apps
and user interface protocols. DECOR automates wide range of routine work:

    * database (re)structuring
    * user management
    * security management
    * business logic security and execution
    * client-server data interaction (server api, client api, protocols)
    * data entry and other client-side forms/screens management

DECOR automates further those tasks with:

    * single-source DB structure and data-input objects description
    * online restructuring of the database schema on demand
    * security policies constructor and automatic checks
    * automatic data-entry objects/screens generation
    * user server session management
    * user, page/screen and linked-data client session management

DECOR is written entirely in Perl 5, but client apps can be in any language.
